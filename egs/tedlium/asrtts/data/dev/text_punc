AlGore_2009-0001304-0002346 Last year i showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap, which for most of the last three million years, has been the size of the lower forty eight states, has shrunk by forty percent.
AlGore_2009-0002346-0004004 But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice. The arctic ice cap is in a sense the beating heart of the global climate system. It expands in winter and contracts in summer. The next slide i show you will be.
AlGore_2009-0004004-0005268 A rapid, fast forward of what's happened over the last twenty five years. The permanent ice is marked in red and as you see, it expands to the dark blue. That's the annual ice in winter, and it contracts in summer.
AlGore_2009-0005268-0006029 And the so called permanent ice, five years old or older you can see is almost like blood spilling out of the body here.
AlGore_2009-0006260-0006905 In twenty five years, it's gone from this to this, this is a problem because the warming.
AlGore_2009-0006905-0008633 Heats up the frozen ground around the arctic ocean, where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which, when it thaws, is turned into methane by microbes compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere, that amount could double if we cross this tipping point.
AlGore_2009-0008633-0009790 Already in some shallow lakes in alaska, methane is actively bubbling up out of the water. Professor katey walter from the university of alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter.
AlGore_2009-0011068-0011830 She's okay, the question is whether we will be and. One reason is this enormous heat sink heats up greenland from the north.
AlGore_2009-0011830-0012659 This is an annual melting river, but the volumes are much larger than ever. This is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest.
AlGore_2009-0012659-0013511 Greenland if you want to know how sea level rises from land base ice melting. This is where it reaches the sea. These flows are increasing very rapidly.
AlGore_2009-0013511-0014534 At the other end of the planet, antarctica, the largest mass of ice on the planet last month, scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance and west antarctica.
AlGore_2009-0014534-0015409 Cropped up on top, some under sea islands is particularly rapid in its melting. That's equal to twenty feet of sea level, as is greenland.
AlGore_2009-0015409-0016856 In the himalayas, the third largest mass of ice at the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers. Forty percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow in the andes, this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city.
AlGore_2009-0016856-0018678 The flows have increased, but when they go away, so does much of the drinking water. In california, there has been a forty percent decline in the sierra snowpack. This is hitting the reservoirs and the predictions, as you've read, are serious. This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires.
AlGore_2009-0018678-0020516 And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate four times as many in the last thirty years. As in the previous seventy five. This is a completely unsustainable pattern if you look at in the context of history, you can see.
AlGore_2009-0020516-0020955 What this is doing?
AlGore_2009-0020955-0021791 In the last five years, we've added seventy million tons of co two. Every twenty four hours. Twenty five million tons every day to the oceans.
AlGore_2009-0021791-0022916 Look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific from the americas, extending westward and on either side of the indian subcontinent, where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans.
AlGore_2009-0022916-0023668 The biggest single cause of global warming along with deforestation, which is twenty percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels. Oil is a problem.
AlGore_2009-0023668-0025415 And coal is the most serious problem the united states is one of the two largest emitters along with china, and the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants. But we're beginning to see a sea change. Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed.
AlGore_2009-0025415-0027030 However, there is a political battle in our country and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal, which is an oxymoron. That image reminded me of something.
AlGore_2009-0027370-0028949 Around christmas in my home in tennessee, a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled. You probably saw it on the news. This all over the country is the second largest waste stream in america. This happened around christmas. One of the coal industry's ads around christmas was this one.
AlGore_2009-0030430-0031168 This is the source of much of the coal in west virginia, the largest mountaintop miner is the head of massey coal.
AlGore_2009-0031304-0031979 Let me be clear about it. Al gore, nancy pelosi, harry reid. They don't know what they're talking about.
AlGore_2009-0031979-0032607 So the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns. This is one of them, part of one of them.
AlGore_2009-0032607-0033881 Coalergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business. That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal.
AlGore_2009-0033881-0034242 The fact is, coal isn't dirty. We think it's clean.
AlGore_2009-0034336-0034477 Smells good too.
AlGore_2009-0034538-0035003 So don't worry about climate change. Leave that up to us.
AlGore_2009-0035176-0035680 Clean coal you've heard a lot about it, so let's take a tour of this state of the art clean coal facility.
AlGore_2009-0035977-0036537 Amazing, the machinery is kind of loud, but that's the sound of clean coal technology.
AlGore_2009-0036643-0037401 And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming, the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything.
AlGore_2009-0037401-0037909 Take a good long look. This is today's clean coal technology.
AlGore_2009-0037909-0038534 Finally, the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge.
AlGore_2009-0038534-0039066 America is in crisis, the economy, national security, the climate crisis.
AlGore_2009-0039066-0039615 The thread that links them all our addiction to carbon based fuels like dirty coal and foreign oil.
AlGore_2009-0039615-0040079 But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess. Repower america.
AlGore_2009-0040079-0040921 With one hundred percent clean electricity within ten years, a plan to put america back to work make us more secure and help stop global warming.
AlGore_2009-0040921-0041490 Finally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems. Repower america. Find out more.
AlGore_2009-0041490-0041607 This is the last one.
AlGore_2009-0042315-0043056 It's about repowering america, one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet.
AlGore_2009-0043195-0043622 Future's over here wind sun a new energy grid.
AlGore_2009-0043770-0044092 New investments to create high paying jobs.
AlGore_2009-0044281-0044591 Repower america, it's time to get real.
AlGore_2009-0044591-0045669 There is an old african proverb that says if you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together, we need to go far quickly.
AlGore_2009-0045669-0045797 Thank you very much.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you've already heard and i'll try to.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 Make some connections myself in case you miss them. I want to start with what i call the official dogma.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 The official dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dogma runs like this. If we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 The way to do that is to maximize individual freedom. The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 Valuable, worthwhile, essential to being human. And because if people have freedom, then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice. The more choice people have, the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have, the more welfare they have.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 This, i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it, and it's also deeply embedded in our lives.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us. This is my supermarket, not such a big one.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 I want to say just a word about salad dressing a hundred and seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket. If you don't count.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 The ten extra virgin olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the off chance that none of the hundred seventy five the store has on offer suit you.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 So this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system, speakers, cd player, tape player, tuner amplifier and in this one.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 Single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems. We can construct six and a half million.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 Different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store. You've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains, the world of communications.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 There was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted, as long as it came from ma bell. You rented your phone, you didn't buy it. One consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never broke and.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 Those days are gone. We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones, especially in the world of cell phones. These are cell phones of the future.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 My favorite is the middle one, the mp three player nose, hair trimmer and creme brulee torch and if.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 If by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet, you can rest assured that one day soon you will. And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 And do you know what the answer to this question now is? The answer is no, it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 In other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things, the same explosion of choice is true health care. It is no longer the case in the united states that you.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 Go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do. Instead, you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you, well, we could do a or we could do b. A has these benefits.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 And these risks b has these benefits and these risks. What do you want to do? And you say, doc, what should i do? And the doc says.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 A has these benefits and risks, and b has these benefits and risks. What do you want to do? And you say if you were me, doc, what would you do? And the doc says. But i'm not you.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 And the result is, we call it patient autonomy, which makes it sound like a good thing. But what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making. From somebody who knows something, namely the doctor to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions, namely the patient. There's enormous marketing of prescription drugs.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 To people like you and me, which if you think about it makes no sense at all. Since we can't buy them. Why do they market to us if we can't buy them? The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask our prescriptions to be changed.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice, as this slide.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 Is meant to indicate we get to. We don't inherit an identity. We get to invent it and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like. And that means that every day when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 You want to be in with respect to marriage and family.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 There was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could, and then you started having kids as soon as you could. The only real choice was who?
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 Not when and not what you did after nowadays. Everything is very much up for grabs. I teach wonderfully intelligent students.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 And i assign twenty percent less work than i used to, and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent, it's because they are preoccupied.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 Asking themselves should i get married or not? Should i get married now? Should i get married later? Should i have kids first or a career first?
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 All of these are consuming questions, and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses. And indeed they should. These are important questions to answer.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 Work.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 We are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 There is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the where. The hi wifi works. I'm not telling you about it because i want to use it.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 So what this means, this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 We should or shouldn't be working. We can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps. And even if they're all shut off.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 Every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game, we are also asking ourselves, should i answer this?
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 Cell phone call. Should i respond to this email? Should i draft this letter? And even if the answer to the question is no, it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 So everywhere we look, big things and small things, material things and lifestyle things. Life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in looked like this.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 That is to say, there were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this, and the question is.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 Is this good news or bad news? And the answer is yes.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 We all know what's good about it, so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it. All of this choice has two effects, two negative effects on people.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 One effect, paradoxically, is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation. With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 I'll give you one very dramatic example of this. A study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans. A colleague of mine got access to.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 Investment records from vanguard. The gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 For every ten mutual funds the employer offered, rate of participation went down two percent.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 You offer fifty funds, ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five. Why? Because with fifty funds to choose from, it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. And of course, tomorrow never comes.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 Understand that not only does this mean that people are gonna have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away. It also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 By not participating, they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution, so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices, and i think it makes the world look like this.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 You really want to get the decision right? If it's for all eternity, right? You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong salad dressing.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 So that's one effect. The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 We end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from, and there are several reasons for this.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from, if you buy one and it's not perfect, and you know what salad dressing is, it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made, and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made, even if it was a good decision.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all. That is disappointing about the option that you chose.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 Second, what economists call opportunity costs. Dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how, how much the the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 Well, when there are lots of alternatives to consider, it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 That make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen. Here is an example.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 For those of you who aren't new yorkers, i apologize.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 But here's what you're supposed to be thinking. Here's this couple on the hamptons. Very expensive real estate. Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves. What could be better? Well, damn it this guy is thinking it's august.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 Everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away. I could be parking right in front of my building.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose, even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 The more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs. Here's another example.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 Now now this cartoon makes a lot of points. It makes points about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing, you're.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 Choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features, and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive. Third.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 Escalation of expectations. This hit me when i went to replace my jeans. I wear jeans almost all the time and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 And you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable. And if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times, they started to feel feel ok. So i went to replace my jeans. After years and years of wearing these old ones and i said, i.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 You know i want a pair of jeans. Here's my size, and the shopkeeper said, do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit? You want button fly or zipper fly? You want stonewashed or acid washed? Do you want them distressed? You want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on and on. He went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 He had no idea what that was.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 So i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting jeans i had ever had. I did better. All this choice made it possible for me to do better.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 But i felt worse why i wrote a whole book to try and explain this to myself. The reason is.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 The reason i felt worse is that with all of these options available, my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 I had very low exp. I had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor when they came in a hundred flavors. Damn it, one of them should've been perfect. And what i got was good, but it wasn't perfect and so i compared what i got to what i expected.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 And what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected. Adding options to people's lives.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 Can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results. Nobody in the world of marketing knows this.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 Cause if they did.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 You wouldn't all know what this was about. The truth is more like this.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse, it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 Nowadays, the world we live in, we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection. The expectation the best you can ever hope for is that this stuff is as good as you expect it to be.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations, my expectations have gone through the roof. The secret to happiness. This is what you all came for. The secret to happiness is low expectations.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 I want to say just a little autobiographical moment that i i actually am married to a wife and and she's really quite wonderful. I couldn't have done better. I didn't settle, but settling isn't always such a bad thing finally.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 One consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible? The answer is clear. The world is responsible. What could you do?
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible? It is equally clear that the answer to the question is you.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 You could have done better with a thous with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display. There is no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even though though the results of the decisions are good, they feel disappointed.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 About them, they blame themselves. Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation. I believe a significant not the only, but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high. And then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves, they think they're at fault.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 And so the net result is that we do better and in general objectively, and we feel worse.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 So let me remind you, this is the official dogma, the one that we all take to be true.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 And it's all false. It is not true. There's no question that some choice is better than none.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 But it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice. There's some magical amount. I don't know what it is. I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 Our welfare now as a policy matter, i'm almost done as a policy matter. The thing to think about is this. What enables all of this choice?
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 In industrial societies is material affluence. There are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 Where the their problem is not that they have too much choice. Their problem is that they have too little, so the stuff i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 Affluent western societies and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 Infants child seats don't help.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 It's a waste of money. What i'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices. It's not simply that they don't help, they actually hurt. They actually make us worse.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 Off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 Not only would those people's lives be improved, but ours would be improved. Also, this is what economists call a pareto improving move. Income redistribution will make everyone.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 Better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice plagues us, so to conclude.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 You're supposed to read this cartoon, and being a sophisticated person, say, ah, what does this fish know? You know nothing is possible in this fishbowl.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 Impoverished imagination, a myopic view of the world. And that's the way i read it at first. The more i thought about it, however, the more i came to the view that this.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 Fish knows something because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom, you have paralysis.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible, you decrease satisfaction.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115008-0115842 You increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction. Everybody needs a fishbowl. This one is almost certainly too limited.
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115842-0116905 Perhaps even for the fish, certainly for us, but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery, and i suspect disaster. Thank you very much.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0001220-0001572 What i'm going to show you first as quickly as i can is.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0001572-0002425 Is some some foundational work, some some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago? This is seadragon.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0002425-0004061 And it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of of visual data. We're looking at many, many gigabytes of of digital photos here, and kind of seam seamlessly and continuously zooming in, panning through the thing, rearranging it in any way we want and.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0004061-0005460 It doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are or how big the images are. In the most of them are ordinary digital camera photos, but this one, for example, is a scan from the library of congress, and it's in the in the three hundred megapixel range.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0005460-0006285 It doesn't. Doesn't make any difference because the only thing that that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0006285-0007452 It's also very flexible architecture. This is an entire book. This is an example of non non image data. This is bleak house by dickens. Every every column is a is a chapter.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0007452-0008335 And to prove to you that it's that it's really text and not an image, we can do something like so to really show that this is a real representation of the text, it's not a picture.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0008335-0009847 Maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e book. I wouldn't recommend it. This is a more realistic case. This is an issue of the guardian. Every large image is the beginning of a section and this really gives you the the the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0009847-0010886 Of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi scale kind of medium. We've also done a little something with the corner of of this particular issue of the guardian. We've made up a fake ad.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0010886-0012134 That's very high resolution, much higher than you'd be able to get in an ordinary ad, and we've embedded extra content. If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here or other models or even technical specifications.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0012134-0013412 And and this this really. This really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with with those limits on on screen real estate. We hope that this means no more, no more pop ups and other kind of rubbish like that shouldn't be necessary.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0013412-0014299 Of course, mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this, and and this one i really won't spend any time on except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0014429-0014840 But those are all the roads in the in the u. S superimposed on top of a nasa.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0014984-0017141 Geospatial image so let's pull up now. Something else, so this is actually live on the live on the web. Now you can go check it out. This is a project called photosynth, which really marries two different technologies. One of them is seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by noah snavely, a graduate student at the university of washington co. Advised by steve seitz at u. W and rick szeliski at microsoft research.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0017141-0018272 A very nice collaboration and so this is this live on the web. It's powered by seadragon. You can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views where we can we can. We can dive through images and have this kind of multi resolution experience.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0018272-0019697 But but the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful. The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these these shots, all taken near grassi lakes in the canadian rockies.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0019703-0020623 All these shots were taken so you see elements here of of stabilized slide show or panoramic panoramic imaging.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0020623-0022084 And these things have all been related related spatially. I'm not sure if i have if i have time to show you any other environments, there are some that are much more spatial, but i would like to jump straight to to one of noah's original data sets, and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first got working in the summer.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0022084-0023357 To show you what i think is really the the punchline behind this, this technology, the photosynth technology, and it's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we've put up on the website we we had to worry about the lawyers and so on.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0023363-0024109 This is a reconstruction of notre dame cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from flickr. You just type notre dame into flickr.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0024109-0025195 And you get some pictures of guys in t shirts and of the campus and so on. And each of these orange cones represents an image that was that was discovered to belong to this model.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0025330-0025999 And so these are all these are all flickr images, and they've all been related spatially in this way, and we can just navigate in this very simple way.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0027083-0027692 You know, i never i never thought that i'd end up working at microsoft. It's very. It's very gratifying to to have this kind. This kind of reception here.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0028063-0029457 So, so this is i guess you can see this is very. This is lots of different types of cameras. It's everything from cell phone cameras to professional slrs. Quite a large number of them stitched together in this environment. And if i can, i'll find some of the sort of weird ones.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0029457-0029856 So many of them are occluded by faces and and so on.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0029961-0031256 There's somewhere in here there is actually there. There is series of photographs here we go. This is actually a poster of notre dame that registered correctly here we can dive in from the poster to a physical view.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0031256-0031456 Of this of this environment.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0031857-0032996 What what the point here really is, is that we can do things with the social environment. This is this is now taking data from everybody from the entire collective memory of of visually what the earth looks like.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0032996-0034175 And link all of that together. All of those photos become linked together and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts. You have a a model that emerges of the entire earth. Think of this as the long tail to stephen lawler's.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0034175-0035353 Virtual earth work and this is something that grows in complexity as people use it and whose benefits become greater to the users as they as they use it their own photos are getting tagged with meta data that somebody else entered.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0035353-0035982 If if somebody bothered to to tag all of these saints and say who they all are, then then my photo of.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0035982-0037008 Notre dame cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data, and i can use it as an entry point to dive into that space into that meta verse using everybody else's photos and and do a kind of a cross modal.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0037008-0038065 And and and cross user social experience that way. And of course, a by product of all of that is immensely rich. Virtual models of of every interesting part of the earth.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0038071-0038867 Collected not just from from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on, but from the collective memory. Thank you so much.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0040016-0040812 Do i do? I understand this? Do i understand this right that what what your software is going to allow is that at some point really within the next few years?
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0040812-0040989 All the pictures.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0040996-0041419 That are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0041420-0041924 Yes, what this is really doing is discovering it's creating hyperlinks. If you will, between between images.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0041924-0042868 And it's doing that based on the content inside the images and that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information that a lot of those images have. Like when you do a web search for images.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0042868-0044222 You type in phrases and the text on the web page is is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of now. What if that picture links to all of your pictures? Then the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of richness that comes out of that is really huge. It's a classic network effect.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0044222-0044442 Blaise, that is truly incredible, congratulations.
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0044442-0044489 Thanks so much.
BrianCox_2009U-0001316-0002336 Last year at ted, i gave an introduction to the lhc and i promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine works. So this is it. And for those of you who weren't there, the lhc is.
BrianCox_2009U-0002336-0003911 The largest scientific experiment ever attempted. Twenty seven kilometers in circumference. Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to six hundred million times a second. It's nothing if not ambitious. This is the machine below geneva.
BrianCox_2009U-0003911-0004814 We take the pictures of those mini big bangs inside detectors. This is the one i work on. It's called the atlas detector, forty four meters wide, twenty two meters in diameter.
BrianCox_2009U-0004814-0005684 Spectacular picture here of atlas under construction so you can see the scale on the tenth of september. Last year we turned the machine on for the first time.
BrianCox_2009U-0005684-0006645 And this picture was taken by atlas. It caused immense celebration in the control room. It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the lhc.
BrianCox_2009U-0006645-0007714 Colliding with a piece of the lhc deliberately and showering particles into the detector. In other words, when we saw that picture on september tenth, we knew the machine worked, which is a great triumph.
BrianCox_2009U-0007714-0009054 I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer or this when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact. About a week later we had a problem with the machine.
BrianCox_2009U-0009054-0010347 Related actually to these bits of wire. Here these gold wires. Those wires carry thirteen thousand amps when the machine is working in full power. Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say no, they don't. They're small wires.
BrianCox_2009U-0010347-0011428 They can do that because when they are very cold, they are what's called superconducting wire. So at minus two hundred and seventy one degrees colder than the space between the stars, those wires can take that current.
BrianCox_2009U-0011428-0012916 In one of the joints between over nine thousand magnets in lhc there was a manufacturing defect, so the wire heated up slightly and its thirteen thousand amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance. This was the result.
BrianCox_2009U-0012916-0013725 Now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over twenty tons and they moved about a foot, so we damaged about.
BrianCox_2009U-0013725-0015255 Fifty of the magnets we had to take them out, which we did. We reconditioned them all, fixed them, they're all on their way back underground. Now by the end of march the lhc will be intact again. We will switch it on and we expect to take data in june or july.
BrianCox_2009U-0015255-0016691 And continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are now. Of course, in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge.
BrianCox_2009U-0016691-0017422 It's easy to refute. I think that the fact that it's so difficult. The fact that we're overreaching is the value of things like the lhc.
BrianCox_2009U-0017422-0019378 I will leave the final word to an english scientist, humphrey davy, who i suspect when defending his protege's useless experiments. His protege was michael faraday, said this nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate.
BrianCox_2009U-0019378-0020061 That there are no mysteries in nature that our triumphs are complete, and that there are no new worlds to conquer.
CraigVenter_2008-0001566-0003143 You know, i've talked about some of these projects before about the human genome and what that might mean, and discovering new sets of genes. We're actually starting at a new point. We've been digitizing biology.
CraigVenter_2008-0003143-0003524 And now we're trying to go from that digital code.
CraigVenter_2008-0003542-0004346 Into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life. So we've always been trying to ask big questions.
CraigVenter_2008-0004472-0005374 What is life is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels. We've tried various approaches.
CraigVenter_2008-0005374-0006856 Paring it down to minimal components. We've been digitizing it now for almost twenty years. When we sequenced the human genome, it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer.
CraigVenter_2008-0006856-0007334 Now we're trying to ask, can we regenerate life?
CraigVenter_2008-0007334-0008894 Or can we create new life out of this digital universe? This is the map of a small organism, mycoplasma genitalium, that has the smallest genome for a species that can self replicate in the laboratory.
CraigVenter_2008-0008894-0009425 And we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome.
CraigVenter_2008-0009425-0010453 We're able to knock out on the order of a hundred genes out of the five hundred or so that are here, but when we look at its metabolic map, it's relatively simple.
CraigVenter_2008-0010453-0011745 Compared to ours, trust me this is simple, but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time, it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell.
CraigVenter_2008-0011745-0012615 So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome, so we could vary the components.
CraigVenter_2008-0012615-0013419 To ask some of these most fundamental questions, and so we started down the road of can we synthesize.
CraigVenter_2008-0013419-0014905 A chromosome, can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before? And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome? A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material.
CraigVenter_2008-0014905-0015526 So our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace.
CraigVenter_2008-0015526-0016702 Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly, but has been increasing. And our latest point would put it on. Now an exponential curve.
CraigVenter_2008-0016702-0017742 We started this over fifteen years ago. It took several stages. In fact, starting with a bioethical review, before we did the first experiments.
CraigVenter_2008-0017742-0018916 But it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult. There's tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna thirty to fifty letters in length.
CraigVenter_2008-0018916-0019962 And it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece, the more errors there are. So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors.
CraigVenter_2008-0019962-0021692 And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information of the genome of phi x one seventy four. It's a small virus that kills bacteria. We designed the pieces, went through our error correction, and had a dna molecule of about five thousand letters.
CraigVenter_2008-0021692-0022326 The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria.
CraigVenter_2008-0022326-0024115 And the bacteria started to read this genetic code made the viral particles the viral particles then were released from the cells, then came back and killed the e. Coli i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model.
CraigVenter_2008-0024253-0024532 They laughed more than you guys are, it's.
CraigVenter_2008-0024736-0025927 And so we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system, but we wanted to go much larger. We wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome.
CraigVenter_2008-0025927-0027295 It's over five hundred and eighty thousand letters of genetic code, so we thought we'd build them in cassettes. The size of the viruses, so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are.
CraigVenter_2008-0027295-0028277 Design is critical, and if you're starting with digital information in the computer, that digital information has to be really accurate.
CraigVenter_2008-0028277-0029729 When we first sequenced this genome in nineteen ninety five, the standard of accuracy was one error per ten thousand base pairs we actually found on resequencing it thirty errors had we used that original sequence, it never would have been able to be booted up.
CraigVenter_2008-0029729-0030779 Part of the design is designing pieces that are fifty letters long that have to overlap with all the other fifty letter pieces to build smaller sub units.
CraigVenter_2008-0030779-0032739 We have to design so they can go together. We design unique elements into this. You may have read that we put watermarks in. Think of this. We have a four letter genetic code, a c, g, and t. Triplets of that letter of those letters code for roughly twenty amino acids that there's a single letter.
CraigVenter_2008-0032739-0034167 Designation for each of the amino acids so we can use the genetic code to write out words, sentences, thoughts. Initially all we did was autograph it. Some people were disappointed there was not poetry.
CraigVenter_2008-0034167-0035697 We designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes. There's enzymes that repair them and put them together and we started making pieces starting with pieces that were five to seven thousand seven thousand letters.
CraigVenter_2008-0035697-0037646 Fit those together to make twenty four thousand letter pieces. Then put sets of those going up to seventy two thousand. At each stage. We grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute. We're trying to get to the point of automation.
CraigVenter_2008-0037646-0038514 So this looks like a basketball playoff. When we get into these really large pieces over a hundred thousand base pairs.
CraigVenter_2008-0038515-0039162 They won't any longer grow readily in e. Coli. It exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology.
CraigVenter_2008-0039119-0040400 And so we turned to other mechanisms. We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair dna that can put pieces together.
CraigVenter_2008-0040400-0041508 Here is an example of it. There's an organism called deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation. You can see in the top panel its chromosome just gets blown apart.
CraigVenter_2008-0041508-0042736 Twelve to twenty four hours later, it put it back together exactly as it was before. We have thousands of organisms that can do this. These organisms can be totally desiccated. They can live in a vacuum.
CraigVenter_2008-0042736-0044886 I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space. Move around, find a new aqueous environment. In fact, nasa has shown a lot of this is out there. Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in.
CraigVenter_2008-0044886-0046477 Yeast puts them together automatically. This is not an electron micrograph, this is just a regular photomicrograph. It's such a large molecule, we can see it with a light microscope. These are pictures over about a six second period.
CraigVenter_2008-0046477-0047922 So this is the publication we had just a short while ago. This is over five hundred and eighty thousand letters of genetic code. It's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure. It's over three hundred million molecular weight.
CraigVenter_2008-0047922-0049731 If we print printed out at a ten font with no spacing, it takes a hundred and forty two pages just to print this genetic code. Well, how do we boot up a chromosome? How how do we activate this? Obviously, with a virus, it's pretty simple. It's much more complicated dealing with bacteria.
CraigVenter_2008-0049731-0051264 It's also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves. You can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one, and that's what you've all heard about with cloning. With bacteria, archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell.
CraigVenter_2008-0051264-0052819 But we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it. We purified a chromosome from one microbial species. Roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice.
CraigVenter_2008-0052819-0054403 We added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome. We digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins and it was pretty stunning. When we put this in the cell and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here.
CraigVenter_2008-0054403-0055214 The new chromosome went into the cell. In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went, but we tried to design the process a little bit further.
CraigVenter_2008-0055214-0057184 This is a major mechanism of evolution right here. We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species. So people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology.
CraigVenter_2008-0057184-0059600 There's enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest dna. The chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one. The cell, the chromosome we put in does. It got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material, chewed it up, and so we ended up just with the cell with the new chromosome. It turned blue because of the genes we put in it.
CraigVenter_2008-0059600-0060769 And with a very short period of time, all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell.
CraigVenter_2008-0060769-0061446 All the proteins changed. The membranes changed when we read the genetic code. It's exactly what we had transferred in.
CraigVenter_2008-0061446-0062453 So this may sound like genomic alchemy, but we can by moving the software dna around, change things quite.
CraigVenter_2008-0062453-0063267 Dramatically now, i've argued this is not genesis. This is building on three and a half billion years of evolution.
CraigVenter_2008-0063267-0064454 And i've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the cambrian explosion where there's massive new speciation based on this digital design.
CraigVenter_2008-0064466-0064890 Why do this? I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs.
CraigVenter_2008-0064890-0066325 We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next forty years. To put it in context for myself, i was born in nineteen forty six. There's now three people on the planet. For every one of us that existed in nineteen forty six.
CraigVenter_2008-0066325-0067970 Within forty years there'll be four we have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water medicines. Fuel for the six and a half billion. It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine. We use over five billion tons of coal.
CraigVenter_2008-0067978-0068259 Thirty billion plus barrels of oil.
CraigVenter_2008-0068260-0069935 That's a hundred million barrels a day when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that. It's going to be a huge challenge. Then. Of course, there's all that co two from this material that ends up in the atmosphere.
CraigVenter_2008-0069935-0071011 We now, from our discovery around the world, have a database with about twenty million genes and i like to think of these as the design components of the future.
CraigVenter_2008-0071011-0072298 The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components and look at the diversity that came out of that. We're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination.
CraigVenter_2008-0072298-0073312 We now have techniques because of these rapid methods of synthesis to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics.
CraigVenter_2008-0073312-0073952 We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
CraigVenter_2008-0073952-0076087 When you think of processing these twenty million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals, new vaccines, we can change just with a small team, do more molecular biology than the last twenty years of all science. And it's just standard selection.
CraigVenter_2008-0076087-0076708 We can select for viability, chemical or fuel production, vaccine, production, et cetera.
CraigVenter_2008-0076708-0077996 This is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer.
CraigVenter_2008-0077996-0079101 You know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look like. We know exactly what their genetic code looks like. We're focusing on now fourth generation fuels.
CraigVenter_2008-0079101-0080720 You've seen recently. Corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment. We have second and third generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar to much higher value fuels like octane or different types of butanol.
CraigVenter_2008-0080720-0082900 But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with co two as its feedstock, and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road and we think we'll have the first fourth generation fuels in about eighteen months.
CraigVenter_2008-0082900-0083182 Sunlight and co two is one method.
CraigVenter_2008-0083636-0085328 But in our discovery around the world, we have all kinds of other methods. This is an organism we described in nineteen ninety six. It lives in the deep ocean about a mile and a half deep, almost at boiling water temperatures. It takes co. Two to methane.
CraigVenter_2008-0085328-0086913 Using molecular hydrogen as its energy source, we're looking to see if we can take captured co two, which can easily be piped to sites, convert that co two back into fuel to drive this process so.
CraigVenter_2008-0086913-0087460 In a short period of time, we think that we might be able to increase.
CraigVenter_2008-0087472-0088361 What the basic question is of what is life? We're truly, you know, have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol chemical industry.
CraigVenter_2008-0088800-0089132 Yeah, if you can't do that at ted, where can you?
CraigVenter_2008-0089132-0090710 Become a major source of energy, but also we're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines you've seen this year with flu. We're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine.
CraigVenter_2008-0090711-0091286 I think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance.
CraigVenter_2008-0091286-0091950 Here's what the future may begin to look like with changing now the evolutionary tree.
CraigVenter_2008-0091950-0093714 Speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria archea, and eventually eukaryotes. We're a ways away from improving people. Our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.
DavidMerrill_2009-0001148-0002562 I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid playing with blocks. As you figured out how to reach out and grasp, pick them up and move them around. You were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.
DavidMerrill_2009-0002562-0003181 Spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us, so.
DavidMerrill_2009-0003181-0004111 As a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects along with my adviser, pattie and my collaborator jeevan kalanithi, i started to wonder.
DavidMerrill_2009-0004111-0005361 What if when we used a computer instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop? What if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information? Physically arranging it the way we wanted?
DavidMerrill_2009-0005361-0005899 This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer by building siftables.
DavidMerrill_2009-0005899-0007051 In a nutshell, a siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie. They're able to be moved around by hand. They can sense each other. They can sense their motion, and they have a screen and a wireless radio.
DavidMerrill_2009-0007051-0008151 Most importantly, they're physical, so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping and siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information.
DavidMerrill_2009-0008151-0009981 And as these tools become more physical, more aware of their motion aware of each other, and aware of the nuance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles. So i'm going to start with some simple examples. This siftable is configured to show video, and if i tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video. This way if i tilt it the other way.
DavidMerrill_2009-0009981-0010729 It rolls it backwards, and these interactive portraits are aware of each other. So if i put them next to each other, they get interested.
DavidMerrill_2009-0010729-0011659 If they get surrounded, they notice that too. They might get a little flustered, and they can also sense their motion and tilt.
DavidMerrill_2009-0011659-0012424 So one of the interesting implications on interaction. We started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data.
DavidMerrill_2009-0012424-0013732 Like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid. So in this case we've got three siftables configured to be paint buckets, and i can use them to pour color into that central one where they get mixed. If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.
DavidMerrill_2009-0013953-0015053 There are also some neat possibilities for education like language math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly and view the results immediately. So here i'm
DavidMerrill_2009-0015322-0016598 This is a fibonacci sequence that i'm making with a simple equation program. Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash up between scrabble and boggle. Basically, in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each siftable.
DavidMerrill_2009-0016598-0017440 And as you try to make words, it checks against a dictionary. Then after about thirty seconds it reshuffles and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.
DavidMerrill_2009-0017632-0017721 Thank you.
DavidMerrill_2009-0017865-0018576 So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab and i managed to get them to try it out and shoot a video.
DavidMerrill_2009-0019193-0020185 They really loved it, and one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions. All you have to say is make words and they know exactly what to do.
DavidMerrill_2009-0020249-0020487 So here's another few people trying it out.
DavidMerrill_2009-0021216-0021563 That's our youngest beta tester down there on the right.
DavidMerrill_2009-0021701-0022565 Turns out all he wanted to do was to stack the siftables up so to him they were just blocks.
DavidMerrill_2009-0022565-0023716 Now this is an interactive cartoon application and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners and this is felix actually.
DavidMerrill_2009-0023716-0024646 And he can bring new characters into the scene just by lifting the siftables off the table that have that character shown on them. Here he's bringing the sun out.
DavidMerrill_2009-0024646-0024867 The sun is rising.
DavidMerrill_2009-0024981-0025159 Now he's brought a tractor into the scene.
DavidMerrill_2009-0025417-0025571 The orange tractor.
DavidMerrill_2009-0025590-0025876 Good job, yeah.
DavidMerrill_2009-0025876-0026358 So by shaking the siftables and putting them next to each other, he can make the characters interact.
DavidMerrill_2009-0026427-0026573 Inventing his own narrative.
DavidMerrill_2009-0026573-0026782 Hello.
DavidMerrill_2009-0026782-0027150 It's an open ended story and he gets to decide how it unfolds.
DavidMerrill_2009-0027592-0027720 Fly away cat.
DavidMerrill_2009-0028164-0029464 So the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently in which siftables act as sounds like lead, bass and drums.
DavidMerrill_2009-0029483-0030464 Each of these has four different variations. You get to choose which one you want to use, and you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want.
DavidMerrill_2009-0030464-0031572 And you inject it by just bumping up the sound siftable against a sequence siftable. There are effects that you can control live like reverb and filter. You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.
DavidMerrill_2009-0031573-0032260 And then overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence. So let's have a look.
DavidMerrill_2009-0032476-0032712 We'll start by putting a lead.
DavidMerrill_2009-0032712-0033181 Into two sequence siftables arrange them into a series.
DavidMerrill_2009-0033181-0033683 Extend it, add a little more lead. Now i put a bassline in.
DavidMerrill_2009-0034206-0034399 Now i'll put some percussion in.
DavidMerrill_2009-0034865-0035249 And now i'll attach the filter to the drums so i can control the effect live.
DavidMerrill_2009-0035419-0036006 I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo to one one way or the other.
DavidMerrill_2009-0036006-0036377 And now i'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression.
DavidMerrill_2009-0036867-0037617 I can rearrange the sequence while it plays. I don't have to plan it out in advance, but i can improvise changing it, making it longer or shorter as i go.
DavidMerrill_2009-0037617-0038222 And now finally i can fade the whole sequence out using the volume siftable tilted to the left.
DavidMerrill_2009-0038812-0038987 Thank you so.
DavidMerrill_2009-0039099-0040108 As you can see, my passion is for making new human computer interfaces that are a better match to the way our brains and bodies work, and today i had time to show you.
DavidMerrill_2009-0040108-0040650 One point in this new design space and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory.
DavidMerrill_2009-0040650-0042082 So the thought i want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms. Thank you very much. I look forward to talking with all of you.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0001280-0002715 I am a writer writing books is my profession, but it's more than that. Of course it is also my great lifelong love and fascination, and i don't expect that that's ever going to change. But that said.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0002715-0003715 Something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0003722-0005907 And the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book, this memoir called, eat, pray, love, which decidedly unlike any of my previous books, went out in the world for some reason and became this big mega sensation international bestseller thing, the result of which is that everywhere i go now, people treat me like i'm doomed.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0005908-0007914 Seriously doomed, doomed, like they come up to me. Now all worried and they say aren't you afraid? Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that? Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0007914-0009442 So that's reassuring, you know, but it would be worse, except for that. I i happen to remember that over twenty years ago, when i first started telling people when i was a teenager, that i wanted to be a writer. I was met with this same kind of sort of fear based reaction, and people would say.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0009442-0011118 Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success? Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you? Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure?
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0011233-0011564 Like that you know, and a a the answer.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0011565-0012800 The short answer to all those questions is yes, yes, i'm afraid of all those things and i always have been and i'm afraid of many, many more things besides that. You know, people can't even guess at like.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0012800-0014813 Seaweed and and other things that are scary. But when it comes to writing the the thing that i've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why, you know, is it rational? Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to? Do you know? And what is it?
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0014813-0016155 Specifically about creative ventures, that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't. Do you know, like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer?
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0016155-0017728 And i don't recall once in his forty years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer. You know, it just didn't come that chemical engineering block john, you know, how's it going? It just didn't come up like that, you know, but.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0017687-0018700 To be fair, right chemical engineers as a group, you know, haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives and.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0018718-0020202 We writers you know, we kind of do have that reputation and not not just writers but creative people across all genres. It seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable, and you know all you have to do is look at the very grim.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0020202-0021446 Death count in the twentieth century alone of of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands, you know, and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0021447-0022280 By their gifts you know norman mailer just before he died last interview. He said every one of my books has killed me a little more.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0022300-0023143 An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work, you know. But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this, because we've heard that kind of stuff.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0023143-0025109 For so long, and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked, and that artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish. And the question that i want to ask everybody here today is, are you guys all cool with that idea?
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0025109-0026962 Like are you comfortable with that? Because you look at it even from an inch away and you know i'm not at all comfortable with that assumption. I think it's odious, and i also think it's dangerous, and i don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century. I think it's better if we encourage you know, our great creative minds to live.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0026962-0028749 You know, and i and i, i definitely know that in in my case, in my situation it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know, particularly given the circumstance that i'm in right now in my career. Which is, you know.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0028749-0030567 Like check it out. I'm pretty young. I'm only about forty years old. I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me, and it's exceedingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book, right?
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0030567-0031230 I i should just put it bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now. It's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0031230-0032130 You know, so jesus, what a thought. You know, like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning and.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0032130-0033455 You know, i don't want to go there, you know i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love and so the question becomes how you know and and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection that that the way that i have to.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0033455-0034762 Work now in order to continue writing is that i have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right? I have to sort of find some way to have a a safe distance, you know, between me as i am writing and my.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0034762-0036273 Very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is gonna be from now on and and as i've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that, i've been sort of looking across time and i've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0036273-0037578 Better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of of creativity and that search has led me to ancient greece and ancient rome.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0037578-0040203 So stay with me cause it does circle around and back, but ancient greece and ancient rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then. Ok, people believed that creativity. Was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons? The greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity daemons.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0040203-0041314 Socrates famously believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar. The romans had the same idea, but they called that sort of disembodied, creative spirit a genius.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0041314-0041841 Which is great cause the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0041841-0042732 Individual they believed that a genius was this sort of magical divine entity who was believed to literally live in the walls.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0042733-0044882 Of an artist's studio. Kind of like dobby, the house elf and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant. There it is right there that distance that i'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work. You know. And everyone knew that this is how it functioned.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0044882-0045575 Right, so the ancient artist was protected from certain things, like for example too much narcissism, right? If your work was brilliant.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0045575-0046816 You couldn't take all the credit for it. Everybody knew you had this like this disembodied genius who had helped you. If your work bombed not entirely your fault. You know, everyone knew your genius was kind of lame and.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0046816-0047304 This is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0047092-0049584 And then the renaissance came, and everything changed. And we had this big idea. And the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe, right above all gods and mysteries. And there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine and and it's the beginning of rational humanism. And people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual. And for the first time in history.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0049584-0050475 You start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius. And i got to tell you, i think that was a huge.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0050475-0052775 Error you know. I think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know, like the font and the essence and the source of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche. It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0052775-0053605 You know, it just completely warps and distorts egos and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance, and i think the pressure of that.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0053607-0054348 Has been killing off our artists for the last five hundred years, and if this is true and i i think it is true.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0054348-0055633 The question becomes, you know what now you know? Can we do this differently? Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery?
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0055633-0057516 Maybe not, you know, like maybe we can't just erase five hundred years of rational humanistic thought in one eighteen minute speech. And there's probably people in this audience who would raise, like, really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0057516-0059332 Rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like i, i'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this, but the the question that i kind of want to pose is you know why not. Why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0059332-0060274 In terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process, a process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0060274-0061061 Basically, everyone here knows does not always behave rationally, and in fact can sometimes feel downright.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0061061-0062915 Paranormal i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone, who's now in her nineties, but she's been a poet her entire life, and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia, she would be out working in the fields and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0062915-0064630 From over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of air and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape. And when she felt it coming because it would shake the earth under her feet, she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was to, in her words run like hell and she would run like hell to the house.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0064630-0066904 And she would be getting chased by this poem. And the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it and grab it on the page, and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be running and running and running, and she wouldn't get to the house. And the poem would like barrel through her, and she would miss it. And she said it would continue on across the landscape, looking as she put it for another poet.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0066905-0068848 And and then there were these times. This is the piece i never forgot. She said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right? So she's like running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her. And then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0068848-0070362 She would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page. And in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0070522-0071278 So when i heard that i was like that's, you know, that's uncanny. That's exactly what my creative process is like.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0071604-0073114 It's not at all my creative process. I'm not the pipeline, you know. Like i'm a mule, and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day and like sweat and labor and like barrel through it really awkwardly. But even i in my mulishness even i have brushed up against that thing.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0073114-0075177 You know, at times and, i would imagine that a lot of you have too, you know, like even i have had work or ideas come through me from a source that i honestly cannot identify. And what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds, but in fact might actually keep us sane and for me the best contemporary example.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0075177-0076796 That i have of how to do that is the musician. Tom waits who i got to interview several years ago on a on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you you know tom. I mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist. You know, like trying to.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0076796-0078352 Control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses. You know that were totally internalized, but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving down the freeway in los angeles. He told me and this is when it all changed for him and and he's like speeding along and all of a sudden he hears.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0078352-0079779 This little fragment of melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes elusive and tantalizing, and he wants it, you know, it's gorgeous and and he longs for it, but he has no way to get it. He doesn't have a piece of paper. He doesn't have a pencil. He doesn't have a tape recorder.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0079779-0081176 So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like i'm going to lose this thing. You know, i'm going to be haunted by this song forever and i'm not good enough and i can't do it. And instead of panicking he just stopped. He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0081176-0081847 Completely novel, he just looked up at the sky and he said, excuse me, can you not see that i'm driving?
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0082189-0083664 Do i look like i can write down a song right now? You know, if you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment when i can take care of you. Otherwise, go bother somebody else today. Go bother leonard cohen, you know.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0083664-0084142 And and his whole work process changed after that. Not the work. The work was still.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0084143-0085316 Oftentimes, as dark as ever, you know, but the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie. The genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it. Kind of back where it came from.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0085316-0086595 And realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing. It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange external thing that was not quite tom.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0086595-0088499 So when i heard that story, it started to shift a little bit. The way that i worked too, and it already saved me once this idea, it saved me when i was in the middle of writing, eat, pray, love and i fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is gonna be a disaster. This is gonna be the worst book ever written.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0088499-0090524 Not just bad, but the worst book ever written and and i started to think i should just dump this project, you know. But then i remembered tom talking to the open air and i i i tried it so i just lifted my face up from the manuscript and i directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and i i said aloud listen you thing.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0090524-0092038 You and i both know that if this book isn't brilliant, that is not entirely my fault right? Cause you can see that i am putting everything i have into this. You know i don't have anymore than this. So if you want it to be better then you've got to show up and do your part of the deal. Ok, but if you don't do that.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0092038-0092867 You know what the hell with it? I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0093256-0094319 Because in the end it's like this. Ok, centuries ago in the deserts of north africa, people used to gather for these.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0094319-0096005 Moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn, and they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific, right? But every once in a while very rarely something would happen, and one of these performers would actually become transcendent.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0096005-0097660 And i know you know what i'm talking about because i know you've all seen at some point in your life a performance like this, you know. And it was like time would stop and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done. You know, a thousand nights before, but everything would align.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0097660-0099526 And all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human. You know, he would be like lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity. And when this happened back then, people knew it for what it was. You know, they called it by it's name. They would put their hands together and they would start to chant.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0099527-0100240 Allah allah allah god god god that's god you know.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0100241-0100874 Curious historical footnote when the moors invaded southern spain, they took this.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0100874-0102756 Custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from allah, allah, allah to ole, ole, ole which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances in spain. When a performer has done something impossible and magic allah, ole, ole allah, magnificent, bravo, incomprehensible there it is a glimpse of god.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0102756-0103586 Which is great because we need that, but the tricky bit comes the next morning, right? For the dancer himself.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0103588-0105046 When he wakes up and discovers that it's tuesday at eleven a m, and he's no longer a glimpse of god, he's just an aging mortal with really bad knees. And you know, maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again, and maybe nobody will ever.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0105046-0106099 Chant god's name again as he spins and what is he then to do with the rest of his life? This is hard. This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0106099-0108280 You know, but maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place, that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you. But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you, you know from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished with somebody else.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0108280-0109652 And you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change everything. You know, this is how i've started to think, and this is certainly how i've been thinking in the last few months. You know, as i've been working on the book, that will soon be published as the.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0109652-0111240 Dangerously frighteningly, overanticipated follow up to my freakish success and and and what i have to sort of. Keep telling myself when i get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid. Don't be daunted, just do your job.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0111240-0112572 Continue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be. If your job is to dance, do your dance. If the divine cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0112573-0113291 For just one moment through your efforts, then ole, and if not, do your dance anyhow.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0113291-0114314 And ole to you. Nonetheless, i believe this, and i feel that we must teach it ole to you nonetheless, just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up.
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0114332-0114442 Thank you.
WadeDavis_2003-0001251-0003452 You know one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways who still feel their past in the wind, touch it in stones polished by rain, taste it in the bitter leaves of plants, just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky way or the.
WadeDavis_2003-0003452-0004094 The myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning, or that in the himalaya the.
WadeDavis_2003-0004094-0006252 Buddhists still pursue the breath of the dharma is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology and that is the idea that the world in which we live in does not exist in some absolute sense, but is just one model of reality. The consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made, albeit successfully many generations ago.
WadeDavis_2003-0006252-0007542 And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives. We're all born. We all bring our children into the world. We go through initiation rites. We have to deal with the inex inexorable separation of death, so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing.
WadeDavis_2003-0007542-0009022 We all dance. We all have art, but what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song. The rhythm of the dance in every culture and whether it is the the penan in the forests of borneo or the voodoo acolytes in haiti.
WadeDavis_2003-0009022-0009881 Or the warriors in the kaisut desert of northern kenya. The curandero in the mountains of the andes.
WadeDavis_2003-0009881-0010764 Or a ca caravanserai in the middle of the sahara. This is, incidentally, the fellow that i travelled into the desert with a month ago.
WadeDavis_2003-0010765-0012331 Or indeed, a yak herder in the slopes of qomolangma everest, the goddess mother of the world. All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being other ways of thinking. Other ways of orienting yourself in the earth, and this is an idea if you think about it can only fill you with hope.
WadeDavis_2003-0012331-0016322 Now together the myriad cultures of the world make up a a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet and is as important to the well being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere. And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths, ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being by the human human imagination since the dawn of consciousness. The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy. It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species, and just as the.
WadeDavis_2003-0016322-0018004 Biosphere has been severely eroded, so too is the ethnosphere, and if anything at a far greater rate, no biologists, for example, would dare suggest that fifty percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction, because it simply is not true. And yet that the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of.
WadeDavis_2003-0018004-0019241 Biological diversity scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity and the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss when each of you in this room were born.
WadeDavis_2003-0019241-0021422 There were six thousand languages spoken on the planet. Now a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules. A language is a flash of the human spirit. It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world. Every language is an old growth forest of the mind, a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
WadeDavis_2003-0021422-0023847 And of those six thousand languages as we sit here today in monterey, fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children. They're no longer being taught to babies, which means, effectively, unless something changes, they're already dead. What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence? To be the last of your people, to speak your language, to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors, or anticipate the promise of the.
WadeDavis_2003-0023847-0024877 Children, and yet that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on earth. Roughly every two weeks, because every two weeks some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables.
WadeDavis_2003-0024877-0026029 Of an ancient tongue, and i know there's some of you who say well wouldn't it be better? Wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language? And i say, great, let's make that language yoruba. Let's make it cantonese. Let's make it.
WadeDavis_2003-0026029-0027025 Kogi and you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language, and so what i'd like to do with you today is sort of take you.
WadeDavis_2003-0027025-0027860 On a journey through the ethnosphere, a brief journey through the ethnosphere to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost.
WadeDavis_2003-0027861-0028558 Now there are many of us who sort of.
WadeDavis_2003-0028560-0029562 Forget that when i say different ways of being, i really do mean different ways of being. Take for example, this child of barasana in northwest amazon, the.
WadeDavis_2003-0029562-0030516 People of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes. Now this is a people who, cognitively.
WadeDavis_2003-0030516-0032712 Do not distinguish the color blue from the color green, because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend. They have a curious language and marriage rule, which is called linguistic exogamy. You must marry someone who speaks a different language, and this is all rooted in the mythological past. Yet the curious thing is in these long houses where there are six or seven languages spoken.
WadeDavis_2003-0032712-0033422 Because of intermarriage, you never hear anyone practicing a language. They simply listen and then begin to speak.
WadeDavis_2003-0033422-0036073 Or one of the most fascinating tribes i ever lived with. The waorani of northeastern ecuador. An astonishing people first contacted peacefully in nineteen fifty eight in nineteen fifty seven five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake. They dropped from the air eight by ten glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures, forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two dimensional in their lives. They picked up these photographs from the forest floor.
WadeDavis_2003-0036073-0038778 Tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure. Found nothing and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil so they speared the five missionaries to death but the waorani didn't just spear outsiders, they speared each other fifty four percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other. We traced genealogies back eight generations and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it, they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old so we speared him anyway.
WadeDavis_2003-0038778-0041342 But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing. Their hunters could smell animal urine at forty paces and tell you what species left it behind. In the early eighties i had a really astonishing assignment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti infiltrating the secret societies, which were the foundation of duvalier's strength and tonton macoutes, and securing the poison used to make zombies.
WadeDavis_2003-0041342-0043370 In order to make sense out of sensation of course, i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of vodoun and voodoo is not a black magic cult. On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview. It's interesting if i asked you to name the great religions of the world. What would you say? Christianity, islam, buddhism, judaism, whatever. There's always one continent left out, the.
WadeDavis_2003-0043370-0044038 Assumption being that sub saharan africa had no religious beliefs, well, of course they did, and voodoo is simply the distillation of these very.
WadeDavis_2003-0044038-0046337 Profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era. But what makes voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead. So the living give birth to the spirits. The spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water, responding to the rhythm of the dance, to momentarily displace the soul of the living, so that, for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god. That's why the voodooists, like to say that.
WadeDavis_2003-0046338-0047422 You white people go to church and speak about god. We dance in the temple and become god. And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit. How can you be harmed? So you see these astonishing.
WadeDavis_2003-0047422-0048269 Demonstrations voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling, burning embers with impunity. A rather astonishing example of the ability of the.
WadeDavis_2003-0048269-0049241 Mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation. Now of all the peoples that i've ever been with, the most extraordinary are the kogi.
WadeDavis_2003-0049241-0050811 Of the sierra nevada de santa marta in northern colombia. Descendants of the ancient tairona civilization, which once carpeted the caribbean coastal plain of colombia. In the wake of the conquest, these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the caribbean coastal plain.
WadeDavis_2003-0050811-0052698 In a bloodstained continent, these people alone were never conquered by the spanish. To this day they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood, but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary. The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness, in stone huts at the base of glaciers.
WadeDavis_2003-0052698-0053944 For eighteen years, two nine year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's womb. Now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother, and for this entire time they.
WadeDavis_2003-0053944-0056945 Are inculturated into the values of their society values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic or we might say the ecological balance and at the end of this amazing initiation, one day they're suddenly taken out. And for the first time in their lives at the age of eighteen, they see a sunrise, and in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape. Suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory.
WadeDavis_2003-0056945-0057875 And the priest steps back and says, you see, it's it's really as i've told you, it is that beautiful. It is yours to protect. They call themselves the elder brothers and they say.
WadeDavis_2003-0057875-0059258 We who are the younger brothers are the ones responsible for destroying the world. Now this level of intuition becomes very important whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape, we either invoke rousseau and the old canard of the no no the.
WadeDavis_2003-0059258-0062802 Noble savage, which is an idea racist in its simplicity, or, alternatively, we invi, invoke thoreau and say these people are closer to the earth than we are. Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia. There's not a lot, not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the asmat or in the chilling winds of tibet, but they have nevertheless through time and ritual forged a traditional mystique of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self consciously close to it, but on a far subtler intuition. The idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness. Now, what does that mean?
WadeDavis_2003-0062802-0063917 It means that a young kid from the andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that.
WadeDavis_2003-0063917-0065973 Resource or that place than a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined. Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant. What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world. I was raised in the forests of british columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut.
WadeDavis_2003-0065973-0067336 That made me a different human being than my friends among the kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of huxwhukw and the crooked beak of heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world. Spirits, they would have to engage during their hamatsa initiation.
WadeDavis_2003-0067336-0069126 Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities, you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here. It's a photograph i took in the northwest amazon just last april. This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about. The most powerful psychoactive preparation of.
WadeDavis_2003-0069126-0070420 The shaman's repertoire, what makes ayahuasca fascinating, is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation, but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources.
WadeDavis_2003-0070420-0071736 On the one hand, this woody liana, which has in it a series of beta carbolines harmine harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic to take the vine alone, is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness, but it's mixed with the.
WadeDavis_2003-0071736-0073158 Leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called psychotria viridis. This plant has in it some very powerful tryptamines very close to brain serotonin dimethyltryptamine five methoxydimethyltryptamine. If you've ever seen the yanomami.
WadeDavis_2003-0073158-0074978 Blowing that snuff up their noses that that substance they make from a different set of species is also contains five methoxydimethyltryptamine to have that powder blown up. Your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity.
WadeDavis_2003-0074978-0075379 It doesn't. It doesn't create the. It doesn't create the.
WadeDavis_2003-0075379-0077430 Distortion of reality. It creates the dissolution of reality. In fact, i used to argue with my professor, richard evan shultes, who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the nineteen thirties i used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because the by the time you're under the effects, there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination.
WadeDavis_2003-0077430-0079232 But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase. They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the mao. Now the fascinating things are that the beta carbolines found within.
WadeDavis_2003-0079232-0080643 That liana are mao inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine so you ask yourself a question. How in a flora of eighty thousand species of vascular plants, do these people find these two?
WadeDavis_2003-0080643-0083271 Morphologically unrelated plants that, when combined in this way, created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts. Well, we use that great euphemism, trial and error, which is exposed to be meaningless, but you ask the indians, and they say the plants. Talk to us. Well, what does that mean? This tribe, the cofan, has seventeen varieties of ayahuasca, all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest, all of which are referable to our eye.
WadeDavis_2003-0083271-0084077 As one species and then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say did i thought you knew something about plants. I mean, don't you know anything?
WadeDavis_2003-0084077-0085205 And i said no. Well, it turns out you take each of the seventeen varieties in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key. Now that's not going to get you a ph d. At harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens.
WadeDavis_2003-0085372-0086743 Now the problem. The problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful, but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world. Meaning our world moves on.
WadeDavis_2003-0086744-0087786 Well, the truth is the twentieth century three hundred years from now is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations, but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or.
WadeDavis_2003-0087786-0088524 Passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet. Now the problem isn't change.
WadeDavis_2003-0088524-0090661 All cultures through all time, have constantly been engaged in a in a dance with new possibilities of life, and the problem is not technology itself. The sioux indians did not stop being sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an american stopped being an american when he gave up the horse and buggy. It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power.
WadeDavis_2003-0090661-0092631 The crude face of domination and whenever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away. These are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to. Whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the penan, a nomadic people.

WadeDavis_2003-0095657-0098613 Into the mountains of tibet where i'm doing a lot of research recently, you'll see it's a crude face of political domination. You know genocide, the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned, but ethnocide the destruction of people's way of life is not only not condemned, it's universally in many quarters celebrated as part of a development strategy. And you cannot understand the pain of tibet until you move through it at the ground level. I once travelled six thousand miles from chengdu in western china over.

WadeDavis_2003-0099166-0100058 Lhasa that i understood the face behind the statistics, you hear about six thousand sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes.
WadeDavis_2003-0100058-0101544 One point, two million people killed by the cadres during the cultural revolution. This young man's father had been ascribed to the panchen lama. That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the chinese invasion. His uncle fled with his holiness in the diaspora that took the people to.
WadeDavis_2003-0101544-0103866 Nepal his mother was incarcerated for the price of for the crime of being wealthy. He was smuggled into the jail at the ti at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn't bear to be without him. The sister, who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp. One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband, that of mao and for that transgression she was given seven years of hard labor.
WadeDavis_2003-0103866-0104571 The pain of tibet can be impossible to bear, but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.
WadeDavis_2003-0104571-0105433 And in the end, then it really comes down to a choice. Do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity?
WadeDavis_2003-0105433-0106921 Margaret mead, the great anthropologist said before she died, that her greatest fear that was was as we drifted towards, this blandly amorphous generic world view. Not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow and.
WadeDavis_2003-0106921-0108682 More narrow modality of thought, but that we would wake from a dream one day. Having forgotten that there were even other possibilities and it's humbling to remember that our species has perhaps been around for six hundred thousand years. The neolithic revolution, which gave us agriculture, at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed.
WadeDavis_2003-0108682-0110559 The poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood. We created hierarchy, specialization surplus is only ten thousand years ago. The modern industrial world as we know it is barely three hundred years old. Now that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia.
WadeDavis_2003-0110559-0111419 When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with ten thousand different voices and it's within that.
WadeDavis_2003-0111419-0112021 Song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are, a fully.
WadeDavis_2003-0112021-0112972 Conscious species fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish and there are great moments of optimism.
WadeDavis_2003-0112972-0114978 This is a photograph i took at the northern tip of baffin island when i went narwhal hunting, with some inuit people, and this man, olayuk told me a marvelous story of his grandfather. The canadian government has not always been kind to the inuit people, and during the nineteen fifties to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements this old man's.
WadeDavis_2003-0114978-0115664 Grandfather refused to go. The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons. All of his tools.
WadeDavis_2003-0115664-0116582 Now you must understand that the inuit did not fear the cold. They took advantage of it. The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide so.
WadeDavis_2003-0116582-0117895 This man's grandfather was not intimidated by the arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing. He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze.
WadeDavis_2003-0117895-0118960 He shaped it into the form of a blade. He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it. He skinned the dog and improvised a harness.
WadeDavis_2003-0118960-0120116 Took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled harnessed up an adjacent dog and disappeared over the ice floes. Shit knife in belt. Talk about getting by with nothing.
WadeDavis_2003-0120116-0120243 And.
WadeDavis_2003-0120243-0123088 This in many ways is a symbol of the resilience of the inuit people, and of all indigenous people around the world. The canadian government in april of nineteen ninety nine gave back to total control of the inuit, an area of land larger than california and texas put together. It's our new homeland. It's called nunavut. It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources. An amazing example of how a nation state can reach, reach, seek restitution with its people.
WadeDavis_2003-0123088-0124224 And finally, in the end, i think it's pretty obvious, at least to all of all us who've travelled in these remote reaches of the planet to realize that they're not remote at all. They're homelands of somebody.
WadeDavis_2003-0124224-0125288 They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time and for all of us. The dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children, become part of.
WadeDavis_2003-0125288-0126243 The naked geography of hope. So what we're trying to do at the national geographic finally is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.
WadeDavis_2003-0126243-0126654 We think that polemics. We think that polemics.
WadeDavis_2003-0126654-0127480 Are not persuasive, but we think that storytelling can change the world, and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world. We get thirty five million.
WadeDavis_2003-0127480-0128274 Hits on our website every month, hundred and fifty six nations carry our television channel. Our magazines are read by millions.
WadeDavis_2003-0128274-0129633 And what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere, where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen and hopefully therefore embrace gradually.
WadeDavis_2003-0129633-0131309 One by one, the central revelation of anthropology that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well being. Thank you very much.
